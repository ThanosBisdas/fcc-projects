        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1931 - 1934</strong> - Studied as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - Elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved a version of the central limit theorem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936</strong> - Published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong> - Obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton and worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong> - The day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS. Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park, Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Travelled to the United States and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945 - 1947</strong> - Lived in Hampton, London, while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1948</strong> - He was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. Working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1952</strong> - He was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1954</strong> - On 8 June, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide. Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954, and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.
          </li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual. The petition received more than 30,000 signatures. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as "appalling".</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - William Jones and his member of Parliament, John Leech, created an e-petition requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of "gross indecency".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for "gross indecency", with immediate effect. Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal conviction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - The government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an "Alan Turing law".
